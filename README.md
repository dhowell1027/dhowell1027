Hello,

With a solid foundation in AI, machine learning, and data analysis, coupled with experience in software engineering and investment management, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your innovative AI projects.
During my time as a Software Engineer at Boeing, I developed and maintained a ticketing database that streamlined software tracking and merging processes. This experience, along with my entrepreneurial ventures in real estate and investment management, has honed my analytical and critical thinking skills. I am adept at working independently as well as collaborating within teams, and I possess a solid understanding of macroeconomics and financial products.
I have also completed an AI Machine Learning Specialization from Stanford University as well as a Certificate in Quantitative Finance (CQF). My technical proficiency includes working with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn, as well as Python and Qiskit for quantum computing. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to apply my skills and further expand my knowledge in an AI-driven environment.
I invite you to explore one of my recent projects on GitHub, the Enhanced AI-Powered Image Classifier: github.com/dhowell1027/Enhanced-AI-Powered-Image-Classifier.  Please feel free to run in Codespaces let me know if you find it interesting. This is just one of the many ways that I have learned how to implement AI to optimize and better understand data.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and certifications can contribute to the success of your team. 

Daniel Howell
